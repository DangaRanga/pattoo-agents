``pattoo`` agents collect IoT data for a centralized ``pattoo`` server.

Introduction
------------

``pattoo`` agents can be configured to report on the status of various types of IoT devices running popular protocols such as:


#. SNMP
#. Modbus

The agents can also report on the status of systems that support the ``python3`` programming language such as:


#. Windows
#. Linux
#. BSD

All ``pattoo`` agents report data using a standardized JSON format. The data is sent to a centralized ``pattoo`` server for processing.

Documentation

About Pattoo
------------

``pattoo`` is based on the original ``infoset`` code created by the `Palisadoes Foundation <http://www.palisadoes.org>`_ as part of its annual Calico Challenge program. Calico provides paid summer internships for  Jamaican university students to work on selected open source projects. They are mentored by software professionals and receive stipends based on the completion of predefined milestones. Calico was started in 2015.
