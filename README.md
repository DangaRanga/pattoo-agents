# pattoo-agents

Pattoo IoT data collection agents.

## Introduction
`pattoo` agents can be configured to report on the status of various types of IoT devices running popular protocols such as:

1. SNMP
1. Modbus

The agents can also report on the status of systems that support the `python3` programming language such as:

1. Windows
2. Linux
3. BSD

All `pattoo` agents report data using a standardized JSON format. The data is sent to a centralized `pattoo` server for processing.
